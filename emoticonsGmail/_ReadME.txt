This folder contains the emoticons used in the generation of the image. 
These are used only to generate the sample output for the emoticons so
you can see the end result without having to go through the process
of entering the HTML into GMail.

What emoticons to use and in what order is specified in the file
"_EmoticonIDsOrder.txt". If you want to change the look of your 
generated Emoji art just change the order of emoticons in that 
file. You are also free to add more by saving the emoticon to 
this folder and adding its ID to the emoticon oder file.

Note:	If you want to add more emoticons simply save them from Gmail
		and save them as <emoticonID>.gif. For example if the emoticonID
		ID is "ezweb_ne_jp.B17" then the emoticon image should be saved as
		"ezweb_ne_jp.B17.gif"
